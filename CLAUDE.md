# Irodori — 3MF Color Fixer

Browser-only tool for repairing and editing multi-color paint on Bambu/Prusa
`.3mf` files, and for splitting painted regions into watertight solids.
**Vanilla JS, no build step, no framework** — scripts are IIFEs attaching
globals to `window`; the `<script>` order in `index.html` is the dependency
graph. Keep it that way (no bundler/ESM migration).

## Run

- **App:** any static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000`. After
  editing files under `js/`, **restart the server on a NEW port** (or
  hard-reload): `http.server` + Chrome's heuristic caching serves stale
  modules and produces phantom "X is not a function" errors.
- **Tests:** `npm test` (= `node --test`). Node's built-in runner;
  `tests/harness.js` loads the browser IIFEs into a `vm` sandbox (with
  vendored three.js + poly2tri) and returns the globals. 52 tests.

## Hard rules

- **Never `Read` a `.3mf`** — they are 2 MB+ zipped XML and will flood your
  context. Inspect via `unzip -l/-p ... | grep`, or load through the pure
  parsers (`ThreeMF.parseMeshes` on an extracted `.model` text).
- The tracked reference model lives in `samples/`. **Untracked `.3mf` files at
  the repo root are the user's working files — leave them alone** (they are
  gitignored).
- Specs live in `docs/superpowers/specs/`, plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`
  — read the relevant one before extending a feature.

## Modules (`js/`, load order matters)

- `paint.js` — Bambu `paint_color` codec: recursive split trees per triangle.
  `Paint.tessellate` is THE geometry convention (corner rotation by `special`,
  midpoint splits, reversed kid order) — anything subdividing faces must match
  it exactly.
- `threemf.js` — `.3mf` zip load/export; `parseMeshes`/`rebuildModelFile`
  (multi-mesh round-trip via recorded offset ranges); filament config
  normalization (all filaments exported as "Generic PLA").
- `subgraph.js` / `select.js` / `cleanup.js` — one `Cleanup` namespace split
  by responsibility: the cached sub-triangle adjacency graph (`mesh._sub`;
  `invalidateSub` clears all mesh caches), read-only selections + symmetry
  queries, and paint-mutating operations (incl. `paintStamps`, the
  slicer-style stamp refinement run on brush release).
- `liepa.js` — Liepa hole filling (rim decimation → 3-D min-weight DP →
  fan strips → density refinement → fairing); the default cap method.
- `caps.js` — boundary-loop extraction and cap triangulation. The cap
  descriptor is `{ verts, extraPts, tris }`: triangle index `i < verts.length`
  → welded global vertex id `verts[i]`, else `extraPts[i - verts.length]`.
- `split.js` — watertight solids from sub-triangle sets. `solidFromSubs` and
  `remainderSolid` share ONE cut cap (the remainder reuses the part's cap
  reversed), so split parts and the remainder stay coincident.
- `viewer.js` — three.js scene, picking, explode animation, preview tints.
- `app.js` — UI glue: tools, palette, history (snapshot/undo), panels.

**Known debt:** `viewer.js` and `app.js` are each one closure over shared UI
state. Splitting them is a state refactor, not a file move — don't attempt it
casually.

## Conventions

- Paint "states" = filament indices; state 0 = the object's default extruder.
- Watertightness in tests = every undirected edge used exactly twice — this is
  **winding-blind**; winding is covered by the Liepa area-weighted regression.
- Mirror/symmetry centers derive from sub-centroid bounds (`axisCenters`) —
  live previews (`mirrorMap`) and final stamp reflection must agree.
- Verification screenshots (`*.jpeg`) and `.playwright-mcp/` are disposable
  and gitignored.
